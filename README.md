Installation
------------
1. At the moment the module needs to be installed manually by copying the corresponding backend and frontend folders.
2. The database should be created from the install_dev.sql file found in the backend folder. Some debugging might be necessary!
You will also need to create some frontend blocks to test.
3. Add the `"erusev/parsedown" : "1.5.1"` package in your composer.json file.
4. Add the `"ezyang/htmlpurifier": "4.6.0"` package in your composer.json file.
