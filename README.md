Installation
------------
1. At the moment the module needs to be installed manually by copying the corresponding backend and frontend folders.
2. The database should be created from the install.sql file found in the backend folder. Some debugging might be necessary!
3. Add the `"erusev/parsedown" : "1.5.1"` package in your composer.json file.
